Hi, I'm Joshua Seigler. I'm a:

## Web developer
I like to make websites. Since 2013 I work at XPO Logistics. Front-end web technology like CSS and SVG comes most easily, but I'm also learning to solve problems with Javascript, JS libraries, and C Sharp. See some of [my personal projects on GitHub](https://github.com/seigler).

## Cryptocurrency enthusiast
[Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoin.com/), [Dash](https://www.dash.org/), and other blockchain applications are just starting to change the world. Sound money is key to personal liberty.

## Boardgamer
I play a lot of boardgames. You can [see my game collection](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/kuqumi?geekranks=Board+Game+Rank&excludesubtype=boardgameexpansion&objecttype=thing&gallery=large&columns=title|status|version|rating|bggrating|plays|comment|commands&own=1&ff=1&subtype=boardgame&sort=rating&sortdir=desc) if you like. My favorite games tend towards low-chance high-strategy, with indirect competition and interesting choices.

## Artist
I make ink sketches sometimes, for fun and to improve my skill.
