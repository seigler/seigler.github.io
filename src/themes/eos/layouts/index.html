      <p>Hi, I'm Joshua Seigler. I'm a:</p>
      <h2>Web developer</h2>
      <p>I like to make websites. Since 2013 I work at XPO Logistics. Front-end web technology like CSS and SVG comes most easily, but I'm also learning to solve problems with Javascript, JS libraries, and C Sharp. See some of my personal projects on GitHub.</p>
      <h2>Cryptocurrency enthusiast</h2>
      <p>Bitcoin, and Dash, and other blockchain applications are just starting to change the world. Sound money is key to personal liberty.</p>
      <h2>Boardgamer</h2>
      <p>I play a lot of boardgames. You can see my game collection if you like. My favorite games tend towards low-chance high-strategy, with indirect competition and interesting choices.</p>
      <h2>Artist</h2>
      <p>I make ink sketches sometimes, for fun and to improve my skill.</p>
