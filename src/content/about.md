Hi, I'm Joshua Seigler. I'm a:

## Web developer
I like to make websites. Since 2013 I work at XPO Logistics. Front-end web technology like CSS and SVG comes most easily, but I'm also learning to solve problems with Javascript, JS libraries, and C Sharp. See some of my personal projects on GitHub.

## Cryptocurrency enthusiast
Bitcoin, and Dash, and other blockchain applications are just starting to change the world. Sound money is key to personal liberty.

## Boardgamer
I play a lot of boardgames. You can see my game collection if you like. My favorite games tend towards low-chance high-strategy, with indirect competition and interesting choices.

## Artist
I make ink sketches sometimes, for fun and to improve my skill.
