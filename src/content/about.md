Hi, I'm Joshua Seigler. I'm a:

## Web developer
I like working with web technology. Since 2017 I work full time for Dash Core Inc, which develops the [Dash cryptocurrency](https://www.dash.org/). Front-end web technology like CSS, HTML, and SVG comes most easily to me, but I'm also learning to solve problems with Javascript, especially React. See some of [my personal projects](/projects/).

## Cryptocurrency enthusiast
[Dash](https://www.dash.org/) and many other blockchain applications are just starting to change the world. Sound money is key to personal liberty.

## Boardgamer
I play a lot of boardgames. You can [see my game collection](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/kuqumi?geekranks=Board+Game+Rank&excludesubtype=boardgameexpansion&objecttype=thing&gallery=large&columns=title|status|version|rating|bggrating|plays|comment|commands&own=1&ff=1&subtype=boardgame&sort=rating&sortdir=desc) if you like. My favorite games tend towards low-chance high-strategy, with indirect competition and interesting choices.

## Artist
I make ink sketches sometimes, for fun and to improve my skill.
